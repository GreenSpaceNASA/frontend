## What this project about?
Initially, we participated in the NASA Space Apps Challenge and from among the various topics, we selected [`What's up with this water`](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/challenges/whats-up-with-this-water/). Have you ever wondered whether the water you swim in or use, or the water surrounding you, is safe enough for swimming or other purposes?

## What this project offer you
With these considerations in mind, we conceived the idea of an application that allows users to:
- Check their current location.
- Find the nearest water source from their current location. 
- Calculate the distance between the two points.
- Retrieve information about the temperature at their current location.
- Determine the safety status of the water, helping users decide whether it's suitable for swimming.
- Identify and learn about endangered species in the area, along with actionable steps to protect them.

## Explaination of water status
We have defined these water status categories based on our experience, we are trying to take official documentation as base source for better definition. So please consider these status as below as reference points.
| Condition | Description | Icon |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Good | The water quality is good | <img src="/public/water-ladder-solid.svg" alt="AppScreenshot" width="30" height="30"> |
| Moderate | The water quality is moderate | <img src="/public/person-swimming-solid.svg" alt="AppScreenshot" width="30" height="30"> |
| Contaminated | The water quality is contaminated | <img src="/public/biohazard-solid.svg" alt="AppScreenshot" width="30" height="30"> |
| Unknown | The water quality is unknown | <img src="/public/triangle-exclamation-solid.svg" alt="AppScreenshot" width="30" height="30"> |
| Radiation | The water quality is contaminated with radiation | <img src="/public/radiation-solid.svg" alt="AppScreenshot" width="30" height="30"> |
| Danger | There are indigenous fauna or flora living in the proximities dangerous for humans | <img src="/public/person-drowning-solid.svg" alt="AppScreenshot" width="30" height="30"> |

## Technological Aspects of this Project

### How to clone the project
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
We work on the process to deploy the app so you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
If you successfully run the app in the local environment, you will see the screenshot as below
